#Hello Hackers 

##Challenge 1: Intro to Commands
In this challenge, you will invoke your first command! When you type a command and hit enter, the command will be invoked, as so:
```bash
hacker@dojo:~$ whoami
hacker
hacker@dojo:~$
```
Here, the user executed the whoami command, which simply prints the username (hacker) to the terminal. When the command terminates, the shell once again displays the prompt, ready for the next command.

**Flag:** 'pwn.college{kwAI5M9AitOsIfwUXU1M9V0nO7M.QX3YjM1wCN3kjNzEzW}'

Once the terminal comes up, the user needs to invoke the ```hello``` command to print the flag 

###New Learnings 
- commands are case sensitive in Linux
- When one command terminates, the shell automatically displays the prompt for the next command without having to be triggered by the user 


##Challenge 2: Intro to Arguments 
Let's try something more complicated: a command with arguments, which is what we call additional data passed to the command. When you type a line of text and hit enter, the shell actually parses your input into a command and its arguments. The first word is the command, and the subsequent words are arguments. Observe:

```bash
hacker@dojo:~$ echo Hello
Hello
hacker@dojo:~$
```
In this case, the command was echo, and the argument was Hello. echo is a simple command that "echoes" all of its arguments back out onto the terminal, like you see in the session above.

Let's look at echo with multiple arguments:
```bash
hacker@dojo:~$ echo Hello Hackers!
Hello Hackers!
hacker@dojo:~$
```
In this case, the command was echo, and Hello and Hackers! were the two arguments to echo. Simple!

###Solve 
**Flag:** 'pwn.college{MmjXaxmpvYce_EUH3mRf3YSFsfJ.QX4YjM1wCN3kjNzEzW}'

Once the terminal comes up, the user needs to invoke the ```hello``` command with the argument ```hackers```

###New Learnings 
- echo is a command used to display the arguments passed to it, out on the terminal
- more than one argument can be passed to the echo command
- When typing a line of commands, the shell parses the input into a command and its arguments, where the first word is the command and the subsequent words are the arguments
